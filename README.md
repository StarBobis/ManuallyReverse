# Hide In Drak
- Most of the mod author won't be happy if you publicly reverse and rip their model from their mod, don't ask why, people just don't get happy.
- You should always ask mod author to try to get the model, that is the easiest way (in most case), if they don't agree, then you will use this scripts in secret (yes, who cares).

# Why
- A question: Why you allow yourself to extract and modify game's model into a mod,but at the same time don't allow other people extract your mod's model to make another mod?
